The overwhelming majority of trips are short - under 20 minutes.

Males are over-represented in overall trips, but appear to be slightly less likely to travel for long distances. Unknown users are significantly more likely than the other groups to travel for longer periods of time.

Gender by User Type

Users of an unknown gender are also more likely to be short-term customers, so short-term customers take longer trips.

Short-term customers rent in different areas than subscribers. Central park and the waterfront, primarily recreational locations, are overrepresented among short-term customers.

Men and women appear to have roughly equivalent rental patterns, with the majority of rentals clustered around business hours. Unknown users rent more on the weekends and continuously throughout the day.

This data suggests that there are two distinct types of user - one that rents a bike every day to ride to work, and one that rents spontaneously on a weekend to get home from a bar.
